# React Quiz

In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

* Begin by executing Create React App by running the following command in your terminal:

`npx create-react-app <appname>` where `<appname>` is what you want to name your app. Example: `npx create-react-app practiceapp`.

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we executed Create React App. What is it for?
Creating the initial template for your React App. Something that you can develop in.

2. What are some benefits of using ReactJS?
State management,
Component based logic and structures
The modules and JS you write will be shorter and will work in more React Apps.

3. What is a React component? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.
They look tags, have a render function, and can use states. They
can be customized and will structure your app if used correctly...

4. What is the significance of the `ReactDOM.render` method? Hint: Check the "ReactDOM" section of the documentation.
Render contains content, components and other tags.

5. What is JSX? Why does Facebook recommend using it? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
This makes writing code easier by having both javascript and XML components in the same code file and easily make variables and logic using components.

6. What does Facebook recommend as the “best way to start building a new React single page application”? Hint: Check the "Installation" section of the React documentation.
npx create-react-app <appname>

7. What is Babel? And what role does it play in converting JSX into vanilla JavaScript? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
Compiles JSX into a JS file that can be run in the browser.

8. What is the significance of { } curly braces in JSX? Hint: Check the "Introducing JSX" section of the documentation.
These wrap values that you can use and modify and can even have values that represent state.

9. What is a component prop? Hint: Check the "Components and Props" section of the React documentation.
It is a way of passing information from a parent component to a child ("Parent giving props to child") and gives the child a way of rendering differently in some way.
